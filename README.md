# credit-card-fraud-detection

## Machine Learning Capstone Project - Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project represents a comprehensive machine learning capstone focused on detecting credit card fraud. It follows a structured workflow to build, optimize, and deploy a predictive model capable of identifying potentially fraudulent transactions.

## Objective
The primary goal is to develop an effective machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The workflow includes:
1. Data Preparation
2. Loading and consolidating relevant datasets.
3. Baseline Modeling: Establishing a baseline using logistic regression.
4. Model Tuning: Enhancing performance through hyperparameter optimization and feature engineering.
5. Model Deployment: Saving, loading, and utilizing the trained model for future predictions.

## Dataset Information
The dataset is a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing:

- Transactions from 1st Jan 2019 to 31st Dec 2020.
- Credit card activity of 1000 customers with 800 merchants.
- Legitimate and fraudulent transactions included.

The dataset was generated using the Sparkov Data Generation tool by Brandon Harris (https://github.com/namebrandon/Sparkov_Data_Generation)

It is available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection/data

## Workflow
1. Data Preparation: Loading and cleaning the dataset.
2. Data Exploration: Understanding the structure, content, and distribution of the data.
3. Model Baseline: Initial model creation using logistic regression.
4. Feature Preparation: Feature engineering to improve data quality and model input.
5. Model Tuning: Hyperparameter optimization to enhance performance.
6. Model Interpretation: Understanding model predictions and ensuring interpretability.
7. Model Deployment: Demonstrating how to save, load, and apply the trained model for predictions.
